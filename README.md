## Description
The successor of the original MHS, a memory-searching tool similar to Cheat Engine.  The new version is written from scratch to be cleaner, faster, more feature-rich, 64-bit, retro-friendly, and harder to detect.  Sixteen-bit data-type searches are built-in along with full support for fully customized expression searches (you get to code the search conditions—no limitations).
